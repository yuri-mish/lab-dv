# Technologies Used 

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Learn [more](#learn-more-about-create-react-app).

## DevExtreme

We are also using DevExtreme component library:
- [overview](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/Guide/React_Components/DevExtreme_React_Components/)
- [components](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/)


# Available Scripts

In the `/front` directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

> No tests yet

### `npm run lint` 

Lints all js and jsx files.
You will see all lint errors in the console.

### `npm run lint:fix` 

Lints all js and jsx files and fixes all possible error.
You will see all lint errors than cannot be fixed by linter in the console.

### `npm run build-themes` 

Rebuilds DevExtreme themes.
DevExtreme use [base](./src/themes/metadata.base.json) 
and [additional](./src/themes/metadata.additional.json)
files for building themes. 

Theme editor: https://devexpress.github.io/ThemeBuilder/

# Contributing

## Code Style 
We are using [NodeArt](https://github.com/NodeArt/linters) eslint plugin. It extended from [Metarhia](https://github.com/metarhia/eslint-config-metarhia) plugin.

You can check all applied eslint rules by running `eslint --print-config .eslintrc.js`

## Git Branching
### Merge Stategy
Rebase + fast-forward

### Branches
`production` - Production branch (Fast-forward only, pull request from master only)

`master` - Develop branch (Fast-forward only, pull request from another branches)

### Rules 
Every pull request must be builded before merge.

Pull requests with many commits must be squashed before merge.

All reviewers must approve a pull request before it can be merged.

Add `WIP` (work in progress) preffix to pull requests name if you have not yet finished your work.


## CSS Styles
We are using SCSS preprocessor. 

### Variables
Locate in [src/scss/variables.scss](./src/scss/variables.scss)

### Global 
Global styles locate in [src/scss/otk-styles.scss](./src/scss/otk-styles.scss). All custom global class names start with `otk-` preffix:
``` scss
.otk-button {
  width: 100px;
  //...
}
```
### Local 
For local styles Create React App provides [Css Modules](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet/). All local styles should be camelCase and start with a lowercase letter. For example:
``` scss
.button {
  //...
}

.icon {
  //...
}

.iconContainer {
  //...
}
```

### DevExtreme 
You should never directly modify DevExtreme styles ([src/dx-styles.scss](./src/dx-styles.scss), [src/themes/generated/](./src/themes/generated)). DevExtreme provides theming [tool](#npm-run-build-themes).

### Overwrite DevExteme Styles 
Sometimes you need to overwrite DevExteme styles. To do it globally (most probably not) you need to modify [src/scss/otk-styles.scss](./src/scss/otk-styles.scss):
``` scss 
.dx-state-enabled {
  background-color: transparent;
}
```
To do it localy you need wrap overwrited DevExtreme classes with parent class:
``` scss 
.myContainer { // Container containing dx components to be modified
  :global(.dx-button) { // Without :global css-modules will create a new class
    background-color: #fff;
  }

  :global(.dx-icon) {
    font-size: 10px;
  }
}
```

### Export Styles/Variables to Js
Create a new module in [src/scss/](./src/scss/). Use as example [src/scss/colors.module.scss](./src/scss/colors.module.scss)

## GraphQL 
TODO

## DevExtreme
### Styles 
Read [this](#overwrite-devexteme-styles) section.

### Table Validation
It's really bad: you cannot leave the validated row until you fill in the whole row. Validate it manualy. Example: ['validateForm'](./src/pages/form-orders/form-order.jsx)
